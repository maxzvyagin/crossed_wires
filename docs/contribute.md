# Contribute

As a living dataset, we gladly welcome contributions to CrossedWires! We hope to
expand to other architectures, machine learning frameworks, and hardware systems.
The organization and hierarchy structure of the dataset/API will be updated as 
needed in order to accommodate these options.  

## How to Contribute

In order to contribute, please submit a pull request on the GitHub repository. 
Code should follow standard reproducibility guidelines, and additional dataset interaction
should streamline with the existing Python API. In order to maintain a cohesive 
database, we will require that model data be uploaded to our existing server.

If you have questions on how to contribute, please feel free to each out to Max
at <mzvyagin@anl.gov>.
