# Installation

## Instructions

It's recommended that you create a fresh environment in order to
install and use the dataset. 

To begin using CrossedWires, install the module using pip:

```
(crossed_wires_venv) $ pip install crossedwires
```

It's also possible to clone the directory if desired and install from
there.

Note that in order to successfully use the dataset, you also must 
install the original files used to originally run the hyperparameter
search. This is needed for proper model definition, and can be done 
using this command:

```
(crossed_wires_venv) $ pip install cross_framework_hpo
```

You should be all set! Now to start loading some models.
